        <p>Minecraft is an indie computer sandbox game created by Swedish programmer Markus Persson and released by his
            studio Mojang AB. In 2009, Persson published an initial version of the game; in late 2011, a stable version
            was released for Windows, Linux, and macOS computers, distributed through the official website. In the
            following years, Minecraft was ported to mobile devices running Android, iOS, and Windows Phone; to
            PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, New
            Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Switch, and Wii U game consoles; and other platforms. In 2014, Microsoft acquired the
            rights to Minecraft along with the Mojang AB studio for \$2.5 billion. In 2017, a multi-platform version of
            the game was released, combining various versions for different devices.</p>

        <p>Persson wrote Minecraft in the Java programming language using the LWJGL graphics library, drawing
            inspiration from games such as Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and Infiniminer. Minecraft gives the player a
            procedurally generated and modifiable 3D world made up entirely of cubes, which can be freely rearranged to
            create complex structures. This feature makes the game similar to various construction toys, such as Lego.
            Minecraft does not set any specific goals for the player, but instead offers a wide range of activities,
            including exploring the world, mining resources, fighting enemies, and more. The game includes additional
            modes, such as "survival," where the player must gather resources on their own, and "creativity," where the
            player has unlimited access to resources. The "redstone" mechanic allows players to create complex logic
            circuits in Minecraft, making it a virtual</p>

        <p>Minecraft is the best-selling game in history: As of 2023, it has sold over 300 million copies on all
            platforms, and the number of players who have played the game at least once a month is 172 million. In 2025,
            Minecraft will be included in the Guinness Book of World Records as the best-selling game in history (over
            350 million copies).</p>
        <hr>
        <p>User-generated content, including YouTube videos and a variety of third-party modifications, played a
            significant role in the game's popularity and commercial success. As the game's popularity grew, the
            possibility of non-gaming applications, particularly in the fields of automated design and education, was
            repeatedly discussed. In 2016, Mojang Studios collaborated with Xbox Game Studios to develop a special
            edition of Minecraft: Education Edition for educational institutions.</p>
